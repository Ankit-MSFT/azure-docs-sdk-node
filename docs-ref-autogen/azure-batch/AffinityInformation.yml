      You can pass the affinityId of a compute node to indicate that this task
      needs to

      run on that compute node. Note that this is just a soft affinity. If the
      target node is busy

      or unavailable at the time the task is scheduled, then the task will be
      scheduled elsewhere.

      content: 'affinityId: string'
