      You can pass the affinityId of a Node to indicate that this Task needs to
      run on

      that Compute Node. Note that this is just a soft affinity. If the target
      Compute Node is busy

      or unavailable at the time the Task is scheduled, then the Task will be
      scheduled elsewhere.
