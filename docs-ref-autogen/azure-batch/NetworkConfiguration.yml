      The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the
      Azure

      Batch Account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses
      to accommodate the

      number of Compute Nodes in the Pool. If the subnet doesn't have enough
      free IP addresses, the

      Pool will partially allocate Nodes, and a resize error will occur. The
      'MicrosoftAzureBatch'

      service principal must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor'
      Role-Based Access

      Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must
      allow communication from

      the Azure Batch service to be able to schedule Tasks on the Nodes. This
      can be verified by

      checking if the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups
      (NSG). If

      communication to the Nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG,
      then the Batch service

      will set the state of the Compute Nodes to unusable. For Pools created
      with

      virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM virtual networks
      ('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks')

      are supported, but for Pools created with cloudServiceConfiguration both
      ARM and classic

      virtual networks are supported. If the specified VNet has any associated
      Network Security

      Groups (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound
      communication. For

      Pools created with a virtual machine configuration, enable ports 29876 and
      29877, as well as

      port 22 for Linux and port 3389 for Windows. For Pools created with a
      cloud service

      configuration, enable ports 10100, 20100, and 30100. Also enable outbound
      connections to Azure

      Storage on port 443. For more details see:
