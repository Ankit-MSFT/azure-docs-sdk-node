      If filePattern refers to a specific file (i.e. contains no wildcards),
      then path

      is the name of the blob to which to upload that file. If filePattern
      contains one or more

      wildcards (and therefore may match multiple files), then path is the name
      of the blob virtual

      directory (which is prepended to each blob name) to which to upload the
      file(s). If omitted,

      file(s) are uploaded to the root of the container with a blob name
      matching their file name.
