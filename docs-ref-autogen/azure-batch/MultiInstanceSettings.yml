      Multi-instance Tasks are commonly used to support MPI Tasks. In the MPI
      case, if

      any of the subtasks fail (for example due to exiting with a non-zero exit
      code) the entire

      multi-instance Task fails. The multi-instance Task is then terminated and
      retried, up to its

      retry limit.

      The difference between common resource files and Task resource files is
      that

      common resource files are downloaded for all subtasks including the
      primary, whereas Task

      resource files are downloaded only for the primary. Also note that these
      resource files are

      not downloaded to the Task working directory, but instead are downloaded
      to the Task root

      directory (one directory above the working directory).  There is a maximum
      size for the list

      of resource files.  When the max size is exceeded, the request will fail
      and the response

      error code will be RequestEntityTooLarge. If this occurs, the collection
      of ResourceFiles must

      be reduced in size. This can be achieved using .zip files, Application
      Packages, or Docker

      Containers.
