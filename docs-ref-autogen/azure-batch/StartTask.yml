      Batch will retry tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a compute
      node.

      Examples of recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an
      unhealthy compute node

      is rebooted or a compute node disappeared due to host failure. Retries due
      to recovery

      operations are independent of and are not counted against the
      maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the

      maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an internal retry due to a recovery operation may
      occur. Because of

      this, all tasks should be idempotent. This means tasks need to tolerate
      being interrupted and

      restarted without causing any corruption or duplicate data. The best
      practice for long running

      tasks is to use some form of checkpointing.

      The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take
      advantage

      of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to
      take advantage of

      such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for
      example using "cmd /c

      MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the command
      line refers to file

      paths, it should use a relative path (relative to the task working
      directory), or use the

      Batch provided environment variable

      (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).

      The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that
      this

      value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will
      try the task once,

      and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry
      count is 3, Batch tries

      the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum
      retry count is 0, the

      Batch service does not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1,
      the Batch service

      retries the task without limit.

      If true and the start task fails on a compute node, the Batch service
      retries the

      start task up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task
      has still not

      completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the
      compute node

      unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This condition can be
      detected via the node state

      and failure info details. If false, the Batch service will not wait for
      the start task to

      complete. In this case, other tasks can start executing on the compute
      node while the start

      task is still running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks will
      continue to be

      scheduled on the node. The default is false.
