      The Job Release Task runs when the Job ends, because of one of the
      following: The

      user calls the Terminate Job API, or the Delete Job API while the Job is
      still active, the Job's

      maximum wall clock time constraint is reached, and the Job is still
      active, or the Job's Job

      Manager Task completed, and the Job is configured to terminate when the
      Job Manager completes.

      The Job Release Task runs on each Node where Tasks of the Job have run and
      the Job Preparation

      Task ran and completed. If you reimage a Node after it has run the Job
      Preparation Task, and the

      Job ends without any further Tasks of the Job running on that Node (and
      hence the Job

      Preparation Task does not re-run), then the Job Release Task does not run
      on that Compute Node.

      If a Node reboots while the Job Release Task is still running, the Job
      Release Task runs again

      when the Compute Node starts up. The Job is not marked as complete until
      all Job Release Tasks

      have completed. The Job Release Task runs in the background. It does not
      occupy a scheduling

      slot; that is, it does not count towards the maxTasksPerNode limit
      specified on the Pool.

      The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take
      advantage

      of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to
      take advantage of

      such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for
      example using "cmd /c

      MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the command
      line refers to file

      paths, it should use a relative path (relative to the Task working
      directory), or use the

      Batch provided environment variable

      (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
