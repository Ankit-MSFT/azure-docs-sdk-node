      Note that if a Job contains no Tasks, then all Tasks are considered
      complete.

      This option is therefore most commonly used with a Job Manager task; if
      you want to use

      automatic Job termination without a Job Manager, you should initially set
      onAllTasksComplete

      to noaction and update the Job properties to set onAllTasksComplete to
      terminatejob once you

      have finished adding Tasks. The default is noaction. Possible values
