summary: >-
  A character filter that replaces characters in the input string. It uses a
  regular expression to

  identify character sequences to preserve and a replacement pattern to identify
  characters to

  replace. For example, given the input text "aa bb aa bb", pattern
  "(aa)\s+(bb)", and replacement

  "$1#$2", the result would be "aa#bb aa#bb". This character filter is
  implemented using Apache

  Lucene.
