  State only version of {@Link @azure/communication-calling#CallAgent} except
  calls is moved to be a child directly of

  {@Link CallClientState} and not included here. The reason to have CallAgent's
  state proxied is to provide access to

  displayName. We don't flatten CallAgent.displayName and put it in
  CallClientState because it would be ambiguious that

  displayName is actually reliant on the creation/existence of CallAgent to be
  available.
