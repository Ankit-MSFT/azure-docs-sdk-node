summary: >
  Abstract representation of a poller, intended to expose just the minimal that
  the user needs to work with.

  This edit of the original interface changes getOperationState() to return
  TState,

  which helps to expose any re-interpretation of the state of the operation
  being polled,

  such as only publicly available properties.
