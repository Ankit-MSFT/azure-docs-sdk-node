    summary: >-
      CancelOnProgress is used as the return value of a Poller's onProgress
      method.

      When a user invokes onProgress, they're required to pass in a function
      that will be

      called as a callback with the new data received each time the poll
      operation is updated.

      onProgress returns a function that will prevent any further update to
      reach the original callback.
    syntax:
      content: type CancelOnProgress = () => void
