      PollOperation is an interface that defines how to update the local
      reference of the state of the remote

      long running operation, just as well as how to request the cancellation of
      the same operation.

      It also has a method to serialize the operation so that it can be stored
      and resumed at any time.

      Attempts to cancel the underlying operation.

      It only optionally receives an object with an abortSignal property, from
      @azure/abort-controller's AbortSignalLike.


      It returns a promise that should be resolved with an updated version of
      the poller's operation.

      Defines how to request the remote service for updates on the status of the
      long running operation.

      It optionally receives an object with an abortSignal property, from
      @azure/abort-controller's AbortSignalLike.

      Also optionally receives a "fireProgress" function, which, if called, is
      responsible for triggering the

      poller's onProgress callbacks.
