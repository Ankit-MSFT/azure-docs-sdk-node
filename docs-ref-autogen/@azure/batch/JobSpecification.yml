    summary: >-
      The details of a Job Manager task to be launched when a job is started
      under this schedule. If

      the job does not specify a Job Manager task, the user must explicitly add
      tasks to the job

      using the Task API. If the job does specify a Job Manager task, the Batch
      service creates the

      Job Manager task when the job is created, and will try to schedule the Job
      Manager task before

      scheduling other tasks in the job.

      The Job Preparation task for jobs created under this schedule. If a job

      task, the Batch service will run the Job Preparation task on a compute

      any tasks of that job on that compute node.

    summary: >-
      The Job Release task for jobs created under this schedule. The primary
      purpose of the Job

      Release task is to undo changes to compute nodes made by the Job
      Preparation task. Example

      activities include deleting local files, or shutting down services that
      were started as part

      of job preparation. A Job Release task cannot be specified without also
      specifying a Job

      Preparation task for the job. The Batch service runs the Job Release task
      on the compute nodes

      that have run the Job Preparation task.

    summary: >-
      The action the Batch service should take when all tasks in a job created
      under this schedule

      are in the completed state. Note that if a job contains no tasks, then all
      tasks are

      considered complete. This option is therefore most commonly used with a
      Job Manager task; if

      you want to use automatic job termination without a Job Manager, you
      should initially set

      onAllTasksComplete to noaction and update the job properties to set
      onAllTasksComplete to

      terminatejob once you have finished adding tasks. The default is noaction.

      The action the Batch service should take when any task fails in a job
      created under this

      schedule. A task is considered to have failed if it have failed if has a
      failureInfo. A

      failureInfo is set if the task completes with a non-zero exit code after
      exhausting its retry

      count, or if there was an error starting the task, for example due to a
      resource file download

      error. The default is noaction. Possible values include: 'noAction',

      1000, with -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000 being the highest
      priority. The default

      value is 0. This priority is used as the default for all jobs under the
      job schedule. You can

      update a job's priority after it has been created using by using the
      update job API.
