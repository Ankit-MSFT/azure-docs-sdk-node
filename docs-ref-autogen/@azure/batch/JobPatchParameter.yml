    summary: >-
      The action the Batch service should take when all tasks in the job are in
      the completed state.

      If omitted, the completion behavior is left unchanged. You may not change
      the value from

      terminatejob to noaction - that is, once you have engaged automatic job
      termination, you

      cannot turn it off again. If you try to do this, the request fails with an
      'invalid property

      value' error response; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP
      status code is 400

      (Bad Request). Possible values include: 'noAction', 'terminateJob'

      the pool for a job

      only when the job is disabled. The Patch Job call will fail if you include
      the poolInfo

      element and the job is not disabled. If you specify an
      autoPoolSpecification specification in

      the poolInfo, only the keepAlive property can be updated, and then only if
      the auto pool has a

      poolLifetimeOption of job. If omitted, the job continues to run on its
      current pool.
