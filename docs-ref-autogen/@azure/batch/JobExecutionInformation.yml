  - name: poolId
    uid: '@azure/batch.JobExecutionInformation.poolId'
    package: '@azure/batch'
    summary: >-
      The ID of the pool to which this job is assigned. This element contains
      the actual pool where

      the job is assigned. When you get job details from the service, they also
      contain a poolInfo

      element, which contains the pool configuration data from when the job was
      added or updated.

      That poolInfo element may also contain a poolId element. If it does, the
      two IDs are the same.

      If it does not, it means the job ran on an auto pool, and this property
      contains the ID of

      that auto pool.

  - name: terminateReason
    uid: '@azure/batch.JobExecutionInformation.terminateReason'
    package: '@azure/batch'
    summary: >-
      A string describing the reason the job ended. This property is set only if
      the job is in the

      completed state. If the Batch service terminates the job, it sets the
      reason as follows:

      JMComplete - the Job Manager task completed, and killJobOnCompletion was
      set to true.

      MaxWallClockTimeExpiry - the job reached its maxWallClockTime constraint.
      TerminateJobSchedule

      - the job ran as part of a schedule, and the schedule terminated.
      AllTasksComplete - the job's

      onAllTasksComplete attribute is set to terminatejob, and all tasks in the
      job are complete.

      TaskFailed - the job's onTaskFailure attribute is set to
      performExitOptionsJobAction, and a

      task in the job failed with an exit condition that specified a jobAction
      of terminatejob. Any

      other string is a user-defined reason specified in a call to the
      'Terminate a job' operation.
    fullName: terminateReason
    syntax:
      content: 'terminateReason?: undefined | string'
      return:
