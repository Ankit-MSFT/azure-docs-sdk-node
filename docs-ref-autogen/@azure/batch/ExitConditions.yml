    summary: >-
      How the Batch service should respond if the task fails with an exit
      condition not covered by

      any of the other properties. This value is used if the task exits with any
      nonzero exit code

      not listed in the exitCodes or exitCodeRanges collection, with a
      pre-processing error if the

      preProcessingError property is not present, or with a file upload error if
      the fileUploadError

      property is not present. If you want non-default behavior on exit code 0,
      you must list it

      explicitly using the exitCodes or exitCodeRanges collection.

      upload error, then the action specified by the exit code takes precedence.
