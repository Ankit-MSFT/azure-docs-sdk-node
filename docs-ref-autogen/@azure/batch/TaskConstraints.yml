    summary: >-
      The maximum number of times the task may be retried. The Batch service
      retries a task if its

      exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the
      number of retries for the

      task executable due to a nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the
      task once, and may

      then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3,
      Batch tries the

      task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry
      count is 0, the Batch

      service does not retry the task after the first attempt. If the maximum
      retry count is -1, the

      Batch service retries the task without limit.

    summary: >-
      The maximum elapsed time that the task may run, measured from the time the
      task starts. If the

      task does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service terminates
      it. If this is not

      specified, there is no time limit on how long the task may run.

    summary: >-
      The minimum time to retain the task directory on the compute node where it
      ran, from the time

      it completes execution. After this time, the Batch service may delete the
      task directory and

      all its contents. The default is 7 days, i.e. the task directory will be
      retained for 7 days

      unless the compute node is removed or the job is deleted.
