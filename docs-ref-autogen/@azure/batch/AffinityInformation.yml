      An opaque string representing the location of a compute node or a task
      that has run

      previously. You can pass the affinityId of a compute node to indicate that
      this task needs to

      run on that compute node. Note that this is just a soft affinity. If the
      target node is busy

      or unavailable at the time the task is scheduled, then the task will be
      scheduled elsewhere.
