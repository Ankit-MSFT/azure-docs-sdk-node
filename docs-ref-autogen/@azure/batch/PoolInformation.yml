      Characteristics for a temporary 'auto pool'. The Batch service will create
      this auto pool when

      the job is submitted. If auto pool creation fails, the Batch service moves
      the job to a

      completed state, and the pool creation error is set in the job's
      scheduling error property.

      The Batch service manages the lifetime (both creation and, unless
      keepAlive is specified,

      deletion) of the auto pool. Any user actions that affect the lifetime of
      the auto pool while

      the job is active will result in unexpected behavior. You must specify
      either the pool ID or

      the auto pool specification, but not both.

    summary: >-
      The ID of an existing pool. All the tasks of the job will run on the
      specified pool. You must

      ensure that the pool referenced by this property exists. If the pool does
      not exist at the

      time the Batch service tries to schedule a job, no tasks for the job will
      run until you create

      a pool with that id. Note that the Batch service will not reject the job
      request; it will

      simply not run tasks until the pool exists. You must specify either the
      pool ID or the auto

      pool specification, but not both.
