  Batch will retry tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a compute
  node. Examples of

  recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an unhealthy compute
  node is rebooted

  or a compute node disappeared due to host failure. Retries due to recovery
  operations are

  independent of and are not counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the
  maxTaskRetryCount

  is 0, an internal retry due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of
  this, all tasks should

  be idempotent. This means tasks need to tolerate being interrupted and
  restarted without causing

  any corruption or duplicate data. The best practice for long running tasks is
  to use some form

  of checkpointing.

      the compute node, and is up to date, then it is not re-downloaded; the
      existing copy on the

      compute node is used. If a referenced application package cannot be

      because the package has been deleted or because download failed, the task

      Batch service

      operations. If this property is set, the Batch service provides the task
      with an

      authentication token which can be used to authenticate Batch service
      operations without

      requiring an account access key. The token is provided via the
      AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN

      environment variable. The operations that the task can carry out using the
      token depend on the

      settings. For example, a task can request job permissions in order to add
      other tasks to the

      job, or check the status of the job or of other tasks under the job.

      command line. The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore
      cannot take advantage

      of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to
      take advantage of

      such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for
      example using "cmd /c

      MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the command
      line refers to file

      paths, it should use a relative path (relative to the task working
      directory), or use the

      Batch provided environment variable

      (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
