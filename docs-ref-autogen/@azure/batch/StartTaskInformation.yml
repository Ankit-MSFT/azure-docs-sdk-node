properties:
  - name: containerInfo
    uid: '@azure/batch.StartTaskInformation.containerInfo'
    package: '@azure/batch'
    summary: >-
      Information about the container under which the task is executing. This
      property is set only

      if the task runs in a container context.

  - name: endTime
    uid: '@azure/batch.StartTaskInformation.endTime'
    package: '@azure/batch'
    summary: >-
      The time at which the start task stopped running. This is the end time of
      the most recent run

      of the start task, if that run has completed (even if that run failed and
      a retry is pending).

      This element is not present if the start task is currently running.

  - name: exitCode
    uid: '@azure/batch.StartTaskInformation.exitCode'
    package: '@azure/batch'
    summary: >-
      The exit code of the program specified on the start task command line.
      This property is set

      only if the start task is in the completed state. In general, the exit
      code for a process

      reflects the specific convention implemented by the application developer
      for that process. If

      you use the exit code value to make decisions in your code, be sure that
      you know the exit

      code convention used by the application process. However, if the Batch
      service terminates the

      start task (due to timeout, or user termination via the API) you may see
      an operating

      system-defined exit code.

  - name: failureInfo
    uid: '@azure/batch.StartTaskInformation.failureInfo'
    package: '@azure/batch'
    summary: >-
      Information describing the task failure, if any. This property is set only
      if the task is in

      the completed state and encountered a failure.
    fullName: failureInfo

  - name: lastRetryTime
    uid: '@azure/batch.StartTaskInformation.lastRetryTime'
    package: '@azure/batch'
    summary: >-
      The most recent time at which a retry of the task started running. This
      element is present

      only if the task was retried (i.e. retryCount is nonzero). If present,
      this is typically the

      same as startTime, but may be different if the task has been restarted for
      reasons other than

      retry; for example, if the compute node was rebooted during a retry, then
      the startTime is

      updated but the lastRetryTime is not.

  - name: result
    uid: '@azure/batch.StartTaskInformation.result'
    package: '@azure/batch'
    summary: >-
      The result of the task execution. If the value is 'failed', then the
      details of the failure

      can be found in the failureInfo property. Possible values include:

  - name: retryCount
    uid: '@azure/batch.StartTaskInformation.retryCount'
    package: '@azure/batch'
    summary: >-
      The number of times the task has been retried by the Batch service. Task
      application failures

      (non-zero exit code) are retried, pre-processing errors (the task could
      not be run) and file

      upload errors are not retried. The Batch service will retry the task up to
      the limit specified

      by the constraints.

  - name: startTime
    uid: '@azure/batch.StartTaskInformation.startTime'
    package: '@azure/batch'
    summary: >-
      The time at which the start task started running. This value is reset
      every time the task is

      restarted or retried (that is, this is the most recent time at which the
      start task started

      running).

      The state of the start task on the compute node. Possible values include:

      'completed'
