    summary: >-
      The SSH private key for the user account. The private key must not be
      password protected. The

      private key is used to automatically configure asymmetric-key based
      authentication for SSH

      between nodes in a Linux pool when the pool's enableInterNodeCommunication
      property is true

      (it is ignored if enableInterNodeCommunication is false). It does this by
      placing the key pair

      into the user's .ssh directory. If not specified, password-less SSH is not
      configured between

      nodes (no modification of the user's .ssh directory is done).
