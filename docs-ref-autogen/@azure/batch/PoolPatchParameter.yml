      The list of application packages to be installed on each compute node in
      the pool. The list

      replaces any existing application package references on the pool. Changes
      to application

      package references affect all new compute nodes joining the pool, but do
      not affect compute

      nodes that are already in the pool until they are rebooted or reimaged.
      There is a maximum of

      10 application package references on any given pool. If omitted, any
      existing application

      package references are left unchanged.

    package: '@azure/batch'
    summary: >-
      A list of certificates to be installed on each compute node in the pool.
      If this element is

      present, it replaces any existing certificate references configured on the
      pool. If omitted,

      any existing certificate references are left unchanged. For Windows
      compute nodes, the Batch

      service installs the certificates to the specified certificate store and
      location. For Linux

      compute nodes, the certificates are stored in a directory inside the task
      working directory

      and an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the
      task to query for

      this location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs'
      directory is

      created in the user's home directory (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and
      certificates are

      placed in that directory.

      element is present,

      it replaces any existing metadata configured on the pool. If you specify
      an empty collection,

      any metadata is removed from the pool. If omitted, any existing metadata
      is left unchanged.

      A task to run on each compute node as it joins the pool. The task runs
      when the node is added

      to the pool or when the node is restarted. If this element is present, it
      overwrites any

      existing start task. If omitted, any existing start task is left
