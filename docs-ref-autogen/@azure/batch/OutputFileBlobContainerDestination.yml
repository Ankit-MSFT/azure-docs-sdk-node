    summary: >-
      The destination blob or virtual directory within the Azure Storage
      container. If filePattern

      refers to a specific file (i.e. contains no wildcards), then path is the
      name of the blob to

      which to upload that file. If filePattern contains one or more wildcards
      (and therefore may

      match multiple files), then path is the name of the blob virtual directory
      (which is prepended

      to each blob name) to which to upload the file(s). If omitted, file(s) are
      uploaded to the

      root of the container with a blob name matching their file name.
