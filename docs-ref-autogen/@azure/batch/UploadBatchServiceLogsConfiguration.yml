      The URL of the container within Azure Blob Storage to which to upload the
      Batch Service log

      file(s). If a user assigned managed identity is not being used, the URL
      must include a Shared

      Access Signature (SAS) granting write permissions to the container. The
      SAS duration must

      allow enough time for the upload to finish. The start time for SAS is
      optional and recommended

      to not be specified.

    summary: >-
      The end of the time range from which to upload Batch Service log file(s).
      Any log file

      containing a log message in the time range will be uploaded. This means
      that the operation

      might retrieve more logs than have been requested since the entire log
      file is always

      uploaded, but the operation should not retrieve fewer logs than have been
      requested. If

      omitted, the default is to upload all logs available after the startTime.
