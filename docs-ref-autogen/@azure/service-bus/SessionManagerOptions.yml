      Indicates whether the `complete()` method on the message should
      automatically be

      called by the sdk after the user provided onMessage handler has been
      executed.

      The maximum number of concurrent calls that the library

      can make to the user's message handler. Once this limit has been reached,

      not be received until atleast one of the calls to the user's message
      handler has completed.

    summary: >-
      The maximum amount of time the receiver will wait to receive a new
      message. If no new

      message is received in this time, then the receiver will be closed.


      If this option is not provided, then receiver link will stay open until
      manually closed.


      **Caution**: When setting this value, take into account the time taken to
      process messages. Once

      the receiver is closed, operations like
      complete()/abandon()/defer()/deadletter() cannot be

      invoked on messages.
