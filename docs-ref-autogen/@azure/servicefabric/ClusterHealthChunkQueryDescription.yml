  The cluster health chunk query description, which can specify the health
  policies to evaluate

  cluster health and very expressive filters to select which cluster entities to
  include in

      Defines a list of filters that specify which applications to be included
      in the returned

      cluster health chunk.

      If no filters are specified, no applications are returned. All the
      applications are used to

      evaluate the cluster's aggregated health state, regardless of the input
      filters.

      The cluster health chunk query may specify multiple application filters.

      For example, it can specify a filter to return all applications with
      health state Error and

      another filter to always include applications of a specified application
      type.
