      VM/VMSS and the operation will only succeed if  the maxPrice is greater
      than the current low

      priority price. <br><br> The maxPrice will also be used for evicting a low
      priority VM/VMSS if

      the current low priority price goes beyond the maxPrice after creation of
      VM/VMSS. <br><br>
