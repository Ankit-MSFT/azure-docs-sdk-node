summary: >
  A checkpoint is meant to represent the last successfully processed event by
  the user from a particular

  partition of a consumer group in an Event Hub instance.

  When the `updateCheckpoint()` method on the `PartitionProcessor` class is
  called by the user, a

  `Checkpoint` is created internally. It is then stored in the storage solution
  implemented by the

  `CheckpointManager` chosen by the user when creating an `EventProcessor`.


  Users are never expected to interact with `Checkpoint` directly. This
  interface exists to support the

  internal workings of `EventProcessor` and `CheckpointManager`.
