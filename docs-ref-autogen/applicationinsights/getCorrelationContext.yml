      Returns an object that is shared across all code handling a given request.

      This can be used similarly to thread-local storage in other languages.

      Properties set on this object will be available to telemetry processors.

      Do not store sensitive information here.

      Custom properties set on this object can be exposed in a future SDK

      release via outgoing HTTP headers.

      This is to allow for correlating data cross-component.


      This method will return null if automatic dependency correlation is
      disabled.
