      Event date time when telemetry item was created. This is the wall clock
      time on the client when the event was generated. There is no guarantee
      that the client's time is accurate. This field must be formatted in UTC
      ISO 8601 format, with a trailing 'Z' character, as described publicly on
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#UTC. Note: the number of decimal
      seconds digits provided are variable (and unspecified). Consumers should
      handle this, i.e. managed code consumers should not use format 'O' for
      parsing as it specifies a fixed length. Example:
      2009-06-15T13:45:30.0000000Z.
