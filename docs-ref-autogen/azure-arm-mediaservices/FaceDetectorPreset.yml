      Specifies the maximum resolution at which your video is analyzed. The
      default behavior is

      "SourceResolution," which will keep the input video at its original
      resolution when analyzed.

      Using "StandardDefinition" will resize input videos to standard definition
      while preserving

      the appropriate aspect ratio. It will only resize if the video is of
      higher resolution. For

      example, a 1920x1080 input would be scaled to 640x360 before processing.
      Switching to

      "StandardDefinition" will reduce the time it takes to process high
      resolution video. It may

      also reduce the cost of using this component (see

      https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/media-services/#analytics
      for details).

      However, faces that end up being too small in the resized video may not be
      detected. Possible

      values include: 'SourceResolution', 'StandardDefinition'
    optional: true
