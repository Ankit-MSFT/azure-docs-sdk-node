      The Audio Analyzer preset applies a pre-defined set of AI-based analysis
      operations, including

      speech transcription. Currently, the preset supports processing of content
      with a single audio

      track.

      The language for the audio payload in the input using the BCP-47 format of
      'language

      tag-region' (e.g: 'en-US').  The list of supported languages are English
      ('en-US' and

      'en-GB'), Spanish ('es-ES' and 'es-MX'), French ('fr-FR'), Italian
      ('it-IT'), Japanese

      ('ja-JP'), Portuguese ('pt-BR'), Chinese ('zh-CN'), German ('de-DE'),
      Arabic ('ar-EG' and

      'ar-SY'), Russian ('ru-RU'), Hindi ('hi-IN'), and Korean ('ko-KR'). If you
      know the language

      of your content, it is recommended that you specify it. If the language
      isn't specified or set

      to null, automatic language detection will choose the first language
      detected and process with

      the selected language for the duration of the file. This language
      detection feature currently

      supports English, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Spanish,
      Russian, and

      Portuguese. It does not currently support dynamically switching between
      languages after the

      first language is detected. The automatic detection works best with audio
      recordings with

      clearly discernable speech. If automatic detection fails to find the
      language, transcription

      would fallback to 'en-US'."
