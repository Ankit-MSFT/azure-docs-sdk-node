       Authentication Options
       clientId                    - Client ID assigned to your app by Azure Active Directory
       authority                   - Developer can choose to send an authority, defaults to " "
                                       (TODO: Follow up with the authority discussion with the PMs - Until then this comment is a placeholder)
       validateAuthority           - Used to turn authority validation on/off. When set to true (default), MSAL will compare the application's authority
                                       against well-known URLs templates representing well-formed authorities.
                                       It is useful when the authority is obtained at run time to prevent MSAL from displaying authentication prompts from malicious pages.
       redirectUri                 - The redirect URI of the application, this should be same as the value in the application registration portal.
                                       Defaults to `window.location.href`.
       postLogoutRedirectUri       - Used to redirect the user to this location after logout. Defaults to `window.location.href`.
       state                       - Use to send the state parameter with authentication request
       navigateToLoginRequestUrl   - Used to turn off default navigation to start page after login. Default is true. This is used only for redirect flows.
