### YamlMime:TSType
name: Task
uid: durable-functions.tasks.task.d.Task
package: durable-functions
summary: |
  Represents some pending action. Similar to a native JavaScript promise in
  that it acts as a placeholder for outstanding asynchronous work, but has
  a synchronous implementation and is specific to Durable Functions.
  Tasks are only returned to an orchestration function when a
  [[DurableOrchestrationContext]] operation is not called with `yield`. They
  are useful for parallelization and timeout operations in conjunction with
  Task.all and Task.any.

  We discourage the usage of `instanceof`-style guards on this type,
  as it is subject to change in the future.
