# Azure tools for Node.js developers

## Azure CLI 2.0
The Azure 2.0 CLI provides a full featured interface to create and configure Azure resources from the command line. The Azure CLI 2.0 is cross-platform and contains powerful query features so you can pipe outputs directly to your favorite command-line tools.

[Install the Azure CLI 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-az-cli2)

##Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a lightweight, but powerful source code editor that runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. Visual Studio Code comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages (such as C++, C#, Python, PHP, Go) and runtimes (such as .NET and Unity). Begin your journey with VS Code with these [introductory videos](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/overview).

##Docker extension for Visual Studio Code

The Docker extension makes it easy to build and deploy containerized applications from Visual Studio Code.
- Automatic dockerfile and docker-compose.yml file generation
- Syntax highlighting and hover tips for docker-compose.yml and dockerfile files
- Snippets for dockerfile files
- IntelliSense (completions) on image names from Dockerhub.com
- Linting (errors and warnings) for dockerfile files
- Command Palette (F1) integration for the most common Docker commands (e.g. Build, Push)
- Deploy images to the cloud by running the Azure CLI in a container
