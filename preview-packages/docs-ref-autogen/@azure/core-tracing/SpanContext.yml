      It is represented as 1 byte (bitmap). Bit to represent whether trace is
      sampled or not. When set, the least significant bit documents that the
      caller may have recorded trace data. A caller who does not record trace
      data out-of-band leaves this flag unset.

      The tracestate field value is a `list` as defined below. The `list` is a
      series of `list-members` separated by commas `,`, and a list-member is a
      key/value pair separated by an equals sign `=`. Spaces and horizontal tabs
      surrounding `list-members` are ignored. There can be a maximum of 32
      `list-members` in a `list`.
