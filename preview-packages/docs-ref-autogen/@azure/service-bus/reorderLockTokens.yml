    summary: >-
      If you try to turn a Guid into a Buffer in .NET, the bytes of the first
      three groups get

      flipped within the group, but the last two groups don't get flipped, so we
      end up with a

      different byte order. This is the order of bytes needed to make Service
      Bus recognize the token.
    syntax:
      content: 'function reorderLockTokens(lockTokens: string[])'
      parameters:
        - id: lockTokens
          type:
            - 'string[]'
          description: An array of lock tokens whose bytes need to be reorderd.
      return:
        type:
