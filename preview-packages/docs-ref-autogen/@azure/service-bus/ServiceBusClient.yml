      If the receiveMode is not provided in the options, it defaults to the
      "peekLock" mode.

      In peekLock mode, the receiver has a lock on the message for the duration
      specified on the

      subscription.


      Messages that are not settled within the lock duration will be redelivered
      as many times as

      the max delivery count set on the subscription, after which they get sent
      to a separate dead letter

      queue.


      You can settle a message by calling complete(), abandon(), defer() or
      deadletter() methods on

      the message.
