    summary: >-
      If you try to turn a Guid into a Buffer in .NET, the bytes of the first
      three groups get

      flipped within the group, but the last two groups don't get flipped, so we
      end up with a

      different byte order. This is the order of bytes needed to make Service
      Bus recognize the token.
    syntax:
      content: 'function reorderLockToken(lockToken: string)'
      parameters:
        - id: lockToken
          type:
            - string
          description: The lock token whose bytes need to be reorded.

        type:
