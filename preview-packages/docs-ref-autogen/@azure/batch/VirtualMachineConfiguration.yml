      The container configuration for the pool. If specified, setup is performed
      on each node in the

      pool to allow tasks to run in containers. All regular tasks and job
      manager tasks run on this

      pool must specify the containerSettings property, and all other tasks may

    summary: >-
      The configuration for data disks attached to the compute nodes in the
      pool. This property must

      be specified if the compute nodes in the pool need to have empty data
      disks attached to them.

      This cannot be updated. Each node gets its own disk (the disk is not a
      file share). Existing

      disks cannot be attached, each attached disk is empty. When the node is
      removed from the pool,

      the disk and all data associated with it is also deleted. The disk is not
      formatted after

      being attached, it must be formatted before use - for more information see

      omitted, no

      pool. The Batch node

      agent is a program that runs on each node in the pool, and provides the
      command-and-control

      interface between the node and the Batch service. There are different
      implementations of the

      node agent, known as SKUs, for different operating systems. You must
      specify a node agent SKU

      which matches the selected image reference. To get the list of supported
      node agent SKUs along

      with their list of verified image references, see the 'List supported node
      agent SKUs'
