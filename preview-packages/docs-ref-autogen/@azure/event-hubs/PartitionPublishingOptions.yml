  The set of options that can be specified for an `EventHubProducerClient`

      The owner level indicates that a publishing is intended to be performed
      exclusively for events in the

      requested partition in the context of the associated producer group.

      To do so, publishing will attempt to assert ownership over the partition;

      in the case where more than one publisher in the producer group attempts
      to assert ownership for the same partition,

      the one having a larger `ownerLevel` value will "win".

      The producer group is only recognized and relevant when certain features
      of the producer are enabled.

      For example, it is used by idempotent publishing.
