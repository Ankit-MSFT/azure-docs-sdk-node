      The owner level associated with an exclusive consumer.


      When provided, the owner level indicates that a consumer is intended to be
      the exclusive receiver of events for the

      requested partition and the associated consumer group.

      When multiple consumers exist for the same partition/consumer group pair,
      then the ones with lower or no

      `ownerLevel` will get a `ReceiverDisconnectedError` during the next
      attempted receive operation.
