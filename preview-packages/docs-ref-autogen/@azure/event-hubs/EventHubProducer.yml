    summary: >-
      A producer responsible for sending `EventData` to a specific Event Hub.

      If `partitionId` is specified in the `options`, all event data sent using
      the producer

      will be sent to the specified partition.

      Otherwise, they are automatically routed to an available partition by the
      Event Hubs service.

      Allowing automatic routing of partitions is recommended when:
       - The sending of events needs to be highly available.
       - The event data should be evenly distributed among all available partitions.

      Use the `createProducer` function on the EventHubClient to instantiate an
      EventHubProducer.

      Once closed, the producer cannot be used for any further operations.

      Use the `createProducer` function on the EventHubClient to instantiate a
      new EventHubProducer.
